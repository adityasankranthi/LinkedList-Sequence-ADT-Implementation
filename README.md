LinkedPartSeq Class: Implements the sequence ADT using a linked list, with a nested Node class containing data, function, and next node pointer.
Invariant Checking: Comprehensive checks to ensure the integrity of the linked list structure, including cycle prevention, accurate node counting, and correct pointer management.
Model Fields: Private methods compute model fields on demand to optimize storage and performance.
Efficiency Testing: Includes tests to ensure the implementation is both functionally correct and efficient.
